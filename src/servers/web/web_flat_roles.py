"""Thread-a (PROGRAM-IDAM-RECOVERY-2) flat WebUI roles for notification-agent.

Thread a is the *simple, flat* login that gets the demo back: three roles —
``admin`` (full), ``read-write`` (use it), ``read-only`` (view). No
granularity (that is Thread b). Roles are computed via the ONE shared guard
(``cloud_dog_idam.RBACEngine`` + the canonical PS-82 §7 permission catalog) —
there is no per-service RBAC fork here; this module only *names* the three
flat roles and derives their permission sets from the shared catalog.

The shared idam ships two baseline roles (``admin`` -> ``*`` and ``user`` ->
the PS-82 §7.2 default grant). The flat lane maps:

* ``admin``      -> the shared ``admin`` baseline (wildcard ``*``).
* ``read-write`` -> the shared ``user`` baseline PLUS the write permissions a
  demo operator needs to actually *use* the notification service (config write,
  send notifications, manage channels/messages).
* ``read-only``  -> the shared ``user`` baseline only (view + self-service);
  every write resolves to a 403 at the enforcement point (never a blank UI).
